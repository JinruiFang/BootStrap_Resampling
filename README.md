# BootStrap_Resampling

In our analysis of movie ratings, I employed robust statistical techniques to assess the variability and significance of our findings. Bootstrap resampling allowed me to estimate the uncertainty around our sample statistics, ensuring the reliability of our conclusions. Additionally, permutation testing was utilized to rigorously assess whether observed differences in movie ratings were statistically significant, even when conventional assumptions about data distribution were not met. These advanced statistical methods provided us with a solid foundation for drawing meaningful insights from our movie rating dataset."
